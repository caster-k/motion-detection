**Webcam Image Comparison and Storage**
  This Python script captures images from a webcam using fswebcam, compares each new capture with a previously stored image, and saves it if the Mean Squared Error (MSE) between them exceeds a specified threshold. This is useful for detecting changes in a scene, such as wildlife monitoring or security applications.
**Requirements**
  Python 3.x
  fswebcam (command-line webcam utility)
  PIL (Python Imaging Library) - Install via pip install Pillow
**Setup and Usage**
Installation:
  Ensure Python and required packages are installed. You can install PIL (Pillow) using:
  _pip install Pillow_
Configuration:
  Modify the paths (previous_path, remote_path) in the script (main_camera_f.py) according to your directory structure.
Execution:
  Run the script:
  _python main_camera_f.py_
The script will continuously capture images from /dev/video0 using fswebcam, compare each new capture with the previous one, and save the new image to remote_path if significant changes are detected.

Details
  Mean Squared Error (MSE): Images are compared using MSE to quantify the difference between consecutive captures.
  Image Storage: Detected changes are saved incrementally in the specified remote_path.
  File Management: Utilizes Pathlib for file operations, ensuring compatibility across platforms.
Notes
  Adjust the MSE threshold (5000 in the script) as per your sensitivity to changes.
  Ensure the script has necessary permissions to access /dev/video0 and write to remote_path.
Feel free to expand on this README with more details specific to your application or any additional functionalities you might add to the script. This document will help users understand the purpose, setup, and usage of your Python script effectively.
